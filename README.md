Welcome to CNVRobot v3.3!

## 1. Description
CNVRobot is an integrated pipeline designed to detect rare germline and somatic copy-number variants (CNVs) and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) regions in the human genome using short-read DNA sequencing from any NGS platform, including targeted sequencing (TS), whole-exome sequencing (WES) and whole-genome sequencing (WGS). It integrates sequencing depth with SNP zygosity across the genome, incorporates advanced data denoising, segmentation and variant prioritization options, as well as detailed visualization for manual inspection of detected CNVs.

## 4. Inputs
- BAM files
- FASTA file - reference file used for alignment
- capture BED file (for WES or TS)
  - first three columns required - contig, start and end; no header
  - requires the same genome assembly as reference file
- master files - spreadsheets of project, control, samples etc.; see below for details

## 5. Initiate run
1. Fill ```./Masters/setting_base.sh``` to specify paths for software.
2. Fill ```./Masters/master_projects``` to specify condition for your project.
3. Fill ```./Masters/master_samples.txt``` and ```./Masters/master_controls.txt``` to specify samples and controls sets for the project.
4. Run ```./CNVRobot/Scripts/run.sh```.

- CNVRobot will link samples and controls for each project by matching ```PROJECT_ID```, ```CAPTURE_ID``` and ```GENOME_VERSION```.
- First column in each master file (```INCLUDE```)  helps to regulate what project to run, what samples to analyze and what control to use.
- Details about each master file are stated below.
- Please avoid space character in any identifier.

## 6. Example data
To run this testing data, please fill ```./Masters/setting_base.sh``` and run ```./CNVRobot/Scripts/run.sh```.  
Simulated example data contains one sample, two controls and reference file.  
Platform: targeted sequencing  
Chromosome locus: 21q21  
Genomic position: chr21:15.0-16.0Mb  
Genome assembly: hg38  
CNVs in the sample: loss of chr21:15.2-15.3Mb, gain of chr21:15.7-15.8Mb  

## 7. Control set selection
GATK recommends the control set consists of at least 40 samples without pathogenic CNVs that were prepared, sequenced and analyzed by the same laboratory protocols and bioinformatic processing. However, any simultaneously processed control is better than no control and the use of just 2â€“5 controls can already be highly effective in reducing the noise from technical artefacts. The control set can overlap with sample set if no pathological CNV are expected. For example, the control set can consist of unaffected parents in pedigree dataset or germline samples in a cancer dataset. Any related samples are automatically excluded from controls during analysis using the main identifier stated in the sample and control spreadsheet. 

## 8. Sex test
Sex test is a part of preparation script. It compares a local coverage of two genes, tested and control, to verify the sex of each control. This helps to recognize potential sample swop that could disturb normalization, denoising and analysis of gonozomes. Genomic coordinates for collection are provided by the sex master file and test on/off is regulated in the project master file. Default setting involves *SRY* and *GAPDH* genes, but requires both genes to be covered. If default genes are not covered by the sequencing, alternative loci can be specified in the sex master file. Pairing customized loci with the project is defined by ```PROJECT_ID```. If customized setting is used, tested and control loci have to be in the same size (bp). Sex test may not be possible to perform in case of some targeted panels where no target at chromosome Y is included.

## 9. Data segmentation
Segmentation of denoised coverage and SNP zygosity data is an important step to recognize abnormal segments (losses, gains and LOH).
### 9.1. Segmentation conditions
The pipeline offers default segmentation setting. However, results can be reviewed and segmentation conditions adapted by user based on data type, quality and expectation. There are two options how to customise segmentation conditions using the project master file ```SEGMENTATION_ID``` column:  
a) **smart segmentation**: ```smart-XX``` identifier pattern is provided within ```SEGMENTATION_ID``` (project master file); where ```XX``` stays for a segmentation coeficient, a number between 0.5 (high sensitivity) and 1 (high specificity). If smart segmentation is used, segmentation conditions are not loaded from the segmentation master file, but calculated automatically by given segmentation coeficient and detected sample quality. For subclonal analysis, pattern is ```smart-XX-sub-YY``` with ```YY``` for a number between 0.1 and 1.0 (for example, 0.5 indicates that subclonal analysis to detect monoallelic CNV in 50% of cells).  
b) **custom segmentation**: Short identifier (for example *my_segm*, *somatic_segmentation* etc.) is provided within ```SEGMENTATION_ID``` (project master file). This identifier is matching with an unique column name within the segmentation master file where all segmentation conditions are defined manually by user.
### 9.2. Sex-flip 
For calling of gonozomal abnormalities, controls with the same sex are required for data denoising. The pipeline runs in sex-flip recognizing mode. If opposite sex is used for denoising (defined in the project master file), pipeline will automatically edit segmentation conditions for gonozomes accordingly, not to call loss/gain due to sex-flip. It should be noted that if female controls are used for male sample, chromosome Y will be excluded from the analysis.

## 10. Master files

  - ```default``` -  automatic use of ```1000```
- ```PADDING``` **(D)** - numeric value - extension (bp) of each interval for depth collection
  - ```default``` - automatic use of ```0``` for WGS and read length for WES and TS (read length is calculated from first control sample)
- ```WAY_TO_BAM``` **(D)** **(!)** - ```absolute```, ```find_in_dir```
  - ```default``` = ```absolute```
  - ```absolute``` - BAM file for each control/sample is provides as absolute path. Final absolute path consists of ```CTRL_BAM_DIR```(projects master file) + ```CTRL_PATH_TO_BAM``` (controls master file) for controls and ```SMPL_BAM_DIR``` (projects master file) + ```SAMPLE_PATH_TO_BAM``` (samples master file) for samples.
  - ```find_in_dir``` - BAM file for each control/sample is found recursively in folder ```CTRL_BAM_DIR```/```SMPL_BAM_DIR``` using control/sample identifier (controls/samples master file) and shared pattern ```CTRL_BAM_PATTERN```/```SMPL_BAM_PATTERN``` (projects master file). Importantly, this pattern has to fit to only one BAM file in the provided folder. This setting is not primarily recommended, but it can be very useful when BAM files are in folders with many subfolders and absolute path would be very long and not very enjoyable to specify for each control/sample. Final file is found as ```CTRL_ID*CTRL_BAM_PATTERN```/```SAMPLE1_ID*SMPL_BAM_PATTERN```. Pattern can be for example *.bam*, *_final.bam* etc.
- ```CTRL``` **(!)** - ```yes```, ```no```
  - ```yes``` - controls will be included in the analysis
  - ```no``` - controls will not be included in the analysis; coverage profile will be denoise only by GC correction

  - ```custom``` - sex test of controls will be performed using custom genomic locations defined within the sex master file under ```PROJECT_ID```
  - ```no``` - sex test of controls will not be performed (for example because chromosome Y has no targets, sex of controls is unknown or user just does not require this test to be done)
- ```CTRL_PON_SEX_SELECT``` **(D)** **(!)** - ```M```, ```F```, ```matched```, ```mixed``` - During pre-processing, controls are denoised by each other and segmented. This allows to look at controls qc and number of segments with given segmentation setting, and possible exclude controls with extreme values if wanted. Denoised data are also further used to determine CNVs in control in annotation and plots. Controls itself and controls with the same ```MAIN_ID``` are excluded from denoising. Setting ```matched``` is recommended, others can be used in case of limited number of controls and/or controls with each sex.
  - ```default``` = ```matched```
  - ```M``` - only male controls are used for denoising of controls
  - ```F``` - only female controls are used for denoising of controls
  - ```matched``` - male controls are used for denoising of male controls and female controls are used for denoising of female controls
  - ```mixed``` - male and female controls are mixed together for denoising of samples; NOT RECOMMENDED setting for two reasons: 1) gonozomes cannot be analyzed, and 2) mixing sex was found to increase false positivity rate for autosomes during pipeline testing (one single sex control provided better sensitivity/specificity than six mixed controls). This setting is recommended to be used only if the sex is unknown and cannot be determined from Y capture.
- ```SMPL_BAM_DIR``` - path to folder with BAM file of samples

- ```SMPL_PON_SEX_SELECT``` **(D)** **(!)** - ```matched```, ```M```, ```F```, ```both_separated```, ```matched_main```, ```matched_each```, ```mixed```, ```all_options```. This value allows to specify what control are used for denoising of samples. Controls with the same ```MAIN_ID``` as sample are automatically excluded from denoising. Selection depends on user's requirements and number of controls with each sex available.
  - ```default``` = ```matched_each```
  - ```M``` - only male controls are used for denoising of samples
  - ```F``` - only female controls are used for denoising of samples
  - ```both_separated``` - ```M``` and ```F``` will be performed separately
  - ```matched_main``` - male or female controls are selected based on sex of the main sample (proband or tumor sample) and used for all related samples (family members or germline sample of the tumor)
  - ```matched_each``` - male controls are used for denoising of male samples and female controls are used for denoising of female samples
  - ```mixed``` - male and female controls are mixed together for denoising of samples; NOT RECOMMENDED setting for two reasons: 1) gonozomes cannot be analyzed, and 2) mixing sex was found to increase false positivity rate for autosomes during pipeline testing (one single sex control provided better sensitivity/specificity than six mixed controls). This setting is recommended to be used only if the sex is unknown and cannot be determined from Y capture. 
  - ```all_option``` - ```M```, ```F```, ```mixed```, ```matched_main``` and ```matched_each``` will be performed separately
- ```CN_FREQ_IN_CTRLS``` **(!)** - ```yes```, ```no```
  - ```yes``` - CNV analysis in controls will be included in the annotation and plots. 
  - ```no``` - CNV analysis in controls will not be included in the annotation and plots, for example because of no or very small number of controls.
- ```GNOMAD_SELECTION``` **(D)** **(!)** - ```capture_filter```, ```capture_filter_and_ctrl_denois```, ```af_filter```, ```af_filter_and_ctrl_denois``` - original gnomAD database of SNP that is provided has to be filtered for efficient performing; usually ```capture_filter```/```capture_filter_and_ctrl_denois``` for TS or WES and ```af_filter```/```af_filter_and_ctrl_denois``` for WGS. Option ```_and_ctrl_denois``` requires reasonable number of controls.
  - ```default``` - automatically selected ```af_filter_and_ctrl_denois``` for WGS and ```capture_filter_and_ctrl_denois``` for WES and TS
  - ```capture_filter``` - SNPs are filtered for those being in the covered regions (for TS and WES)
  - ```capture_filter_and_ctrl_denois``` - ```capture_filter``` + noisy SNPs (recognized in controls) are excluded; noise in controls is found by default parameters in the base master file
  - ```af_filter``` - SNPs with very rare alternative alleles are excluded; allelic frequency is defined by default parameter in the base master file
  - ```af_filter_and_ctrl_denois``` - ```af_filter``` + noisy SNPs (recognized in controls) are excluded; noise in controls is found by default parameters in the base master file

  - smart segmentation - ```smart-XX``` (without sub-clonal analysis) or ```smart-XX-sub-YY``` (with subclonal analysis); XX = number between 0.5 (high sensitivity) and 1.0 (high specificity), YY = number between 0.1 and 1.0 (for example, 0.5 indicates that subclonal analysis to detect monoallelic CNV in 50% of cells)
  - custom segmentation - short identifier (for example *my_segm*, *somatic_segmentation* etc.) to select required segmentation conditions from the segmentation master file
- ```SEGMENTATION_ID_USE``` **(D)** **(!)** - ```segm_id```, ```full``` - This controls what identifier of segmentation will be used in files names.
  - ```default``` = ```segm_id```
  - ```segm_id``` - RECOMMENDED; segmentation condition will be used in files names by its short identifier (full version is still kept inside of the segmentation table)
  - ```full``` - all segmetation parameters in numeric version will be used in files names; not primarily recommended due to creating long file names that can be difficult in some systems
- ```NOTE``` - any additional information that user wants to keep with the project

- download required gene annotation from [UCSC website](https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTables?hgsid=968304787_9UHI0R5esZuD1z4azUHoV9dEdsoU)
- columns have to be named as follows (order does not need to be the same):
  - ```gene_id```: identifier that will be displayed at plots and used for annotation (usually gene symbol)
  - ```chrom```: chromosome
  - ```strand```: + or - for strand
  - ```txStart```: transcription start position
  - ```txEnd```: transcription end position
  - ```cdsStart```: coding region start
  - ```cdsEnd```: coding region end
  - ```exonStarts```: exon start positions
  - ```exonEnds```: exon end positions
 Most of the columns will match automatically, only ```gene_id``` needs to picked and rename by user, for example by command ```sed -i 's/name2/gene_id/g' file.txt```. Table should never be edited in EXCEL due to renaming some gene symbols to dates.

## 13. Project-specific plot
This is an advance option that allows to produce personalized detail plots for additional regions with personalized annotation.
Customized R scripts is required, as provided example. This script has to be places to ```/Scripts/R/``` folder and named as ```plot_CN_PROJECT_ID.R```. It is then recognized as source in ```plot_CN.R``` and produces plots within ```/project_specific_regions/``` folder.

## 14. Databases source
- processing of the databases from original source is available under request
- original source of databases:
  - [gnomAD SNP v2.1](https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/downloads) (exome and genome data was downloaded, combined and processed into a simple VCF file in hg19/GRCh37 version; hg38/GRCh38 version prepared by liftover)
  - [Database of Genomic Variants (DGV, TCAG) v2020-02-25](http://dgv.tcag.ca/dgv/app/home)
  - [UCSC chromosome bands and centromeres](https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/downloads.html)
  - [RefSeq](https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTables)


## 15. Limitations
CNVRobot pipeline is not suitable for detection of common population CNVs and CNVs in low mappability regions. It should be noted that it is a depth of coverage analysis within certains bins and so starts and ends of abnormalities are not precisily mapped. CNVRobot can detect only unbalanced changes. Similarly to DNA microarrays, coverage-based analysis can be problematic if the ploidy of the sample is changed, as it is based on median centering normalization.
